Exercise:

For this exercise, you will need to use the pandas library to manipulate a dataset. The dataset contains information on different types of fruit, including the type of fruit, the price per pound, and the quantity available.

Import the pandas library and read in the dataset from a CSV file.
Use the head() function to view the first few rows of the dataset.
Use the describe() function to view summary statistics for the dataset.
Create a new column in the dataset called total_cost, which is the product of the price_per_pound and quantity columns.
Use the groupby() function to group the data by the type column and calculate the mean total_cost for each type of fruit.
Use the sort_values() function to sort the data by the total_cost column in descending order.
Use the to_csv() function to save the modified dataset to a new CSV file.
Practice Problem:

For this practice problem, you will need to use the numpy and matplotlib libraries to visualize a dataset. The dataset contains information on the average monthly temperature in a city over a period of several years.

Import the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
Read in the dataset from a CSV file using numpy.
Use matplotlib to create a line plot of the temperature data.
Add axis labels and a title to the plot.
Use the legend() function to add a legend to the plot.
Save the plot to an image file using the savefig() function.
