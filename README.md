The Data Science Handbook was created by Prateek Tripathi. Prateek is a data science enthusiast who loves to think in terms of matrices and is always looking for new ways to apply data science to real-world problems. You can reach out to him at apkadost888@gmail.com.

To get started, I recommend the following path:

Begin by reading through the notes on data exploration techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA). These will introduce you to the basics of analyzing and understanding your data.
Next, move on to the notes on data manipulation using pandas and data wrangling in Python. These will teach you how to clean, transform, and prepare your data for further analysis.
Explore the notes on data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, and learn how to create different types of plots to visualize and communicate your findings.
If you need to gather data from the web, check out the notes on web scraping with beautiful soup.
Move on to the notes on feature engineering and feature selection, and learn how to create and select the most important features in your data.
Finally, read through the notes on scipy, which covers a variety of useful tools and techniques for scientific computing in Python
