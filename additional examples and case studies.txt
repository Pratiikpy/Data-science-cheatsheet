Data Visualization
Examples and Case Studies
A data scientist is exploring a dataset of customer demographics and purchases. They use data visualization techniques to create scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts to understand the relationships between variables and identify trends in the data.
A business analyst is analyzing sales data from a retail store. They use data visualization techniques to create line charts and heatmaps to track sales over time and identify high-performing products.
Exercises and Practice Problems
Using a dataset of your choice, create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two variables.
Using a dataset of your choice, create a bar chart to compare the distribution of a categorical variable.
More In-Depth Explanations
Data visualization techniques can be used to identify patterns and relationships in data. For example, scatter plots can show the relationship between two variables, while histograms can show the distribution of a single variable.
Different data visualization techniques are suited to different types of data and different types of analyses. For example, line charts are often used to track trends over time, while bar charts are useful for comparing the distribution of categorical variables.
Web Scraping
Examples and Case Studies
A data scientist is gathering data on product prices from multiple online retailers. They use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the websites and store it in a structured format for analysis.
A researcher is collecting data on news articles for a study on media bias. They use web scraping techniques to scrape articles from multiple news websites and classify them based on their content and source.
Exercises and Practice Problems
Using a website of your choice, use web scraping techniques to extract data from a table on the website.
Using a website of your choice, use web scraping techniques to extract data from a form on the website.
More In-Depth Explanations
Web scraping involves using code to extract data from websites. This can be done using libraries such as Beautiful Soup or Selenium.
Web scraping can be used to gather data that is not easily available or that would be time-consuming to collect manually. However, it is important to be mindful of website policies and ethical considerations when scraping data.

Feature Engineering
Examples and Case Studies
A data scientist is working on a machine learning model to predict the price of a house based on various features such as size, location, and age. They use feature engineering techniques to create new features, such as the ratio of size to age, and to transform existing features, such as standardizing the values of size.
A researcher is analyzing customer data to identify patterns and predict churn. They use feature engineering techniques to create new features based on customer behavior, such as the number of days since the last purchase, and to encode categorical variables, such as gender.
Exercises and Practice Problems
Using a dataset of your choice, create a new feature based on the values of two or more existing features.
Using a dataset of your choice, transform an existing feature using a technique such as standardization or normalization.
More In-Depth Explanations
Feature engineering involves creating and modifying features in a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models. This can include creating new features based on existing ones, transforming existing features, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine learning process, as the quality and relevance of the features can greatly impact the model's performance.
Feature Selection
Examples and Case Studies
A data scientist is working on a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer churning. They use feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features in the dataset and remove any unnecessary or redundant features.
A researcher is analyzing a dataset of genetic data to identify risk factors for a particular disease. They use feature selection techniques to select the most relevant genetic markers and build a predictive model.
Exercises and Practice Problems
Using a dataset of your choice, use a feature selection technique such as correlation analysis to identify the most relevant features.
Using a dataset of your choice, use a feature selection technique such as recursive feature elimination to remove unnecessary or redundant features.
More In-Depth Explanations
Feature selection involves identifying and selecting the most relevant features in a dataset for a particular task. This can be done using techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, and dimensionality reduction.
Feature selection is important because it can reduce the complexity of a model, improve its interpretability, and reduce the risk of overfitting.
SciPy
Examples and Case Studies
A data scientist is fitting a regression model to a dataset. They use SciPy's optimization functions to find the optimal coefficients for the model.
A researcher is analyzing a signal from a sensor. They use SciPy's signal processing functions to filter the signal and extract features for further analysis.
Exercises and Practice Problems
Using a dataset of your choice, use SciPy's optimization functions to fit a linear regression model.
Using a signal of your choice, use SciPy's signal processing functions to filter the signal and extract features.
More In-Depth Explanations
SciPy is a collection of scientific and numerical computing tools in Python. It includes functions for optimization, linear algebra, signal and image processing, and more.
SciPy can be used in a variety of scientific and technical contexts, including optimization, linear algebra, signal and image processing, and statistics.
Different SciPy functions have different input and output formats and parameters, so it is important to choose the appropriate function and set the parameters appropriately
